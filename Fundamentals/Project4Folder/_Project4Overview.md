# Project 4 Overview

Project 4 acts as an intermediate between projects 3 and 5. However it still plays a pivotal role in the construction of the HACK computer. Specifically, we gain an insight into how the `CPU`, `ROM` (non-volatile memory) and `RAM` (Volatile memory) communicate. This will be explored further in project 5 when the parts are all connected. In this project, the main task is to write programs in the **HACK assembly language**. We write two programs as shown below:

- Fill.asm
- Mult.asm

The first program serves as an introduction to **`Input/Output (I/O)`** where the key pressed on the keyboard in use has the direct effect of turning the screen in the hardware simulator either to black or white. The second program is simpler as it only required us to multiply two numbers together.

A significant challenge of this project was programming in assembly. The reason for this is that assembly is abstract meaning that it requires a good understanding of the theory behind how the CPU and memory communicate. For this reason, a markdown file has been given as `Project4Folder/CPUMemory.md`.

A markdown file for the explanation of the keyboard and the screen has been given to aid understanding of how these input and output devices work with the computer, specifically the CPU. This file is located in: `Project4Folder/inputOutput.md`.
