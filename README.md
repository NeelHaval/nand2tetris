## Note ##
All content within the project is based on the book: "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken. 

All project material and part of the software used in completion of this project has been obtained from the [nand2tetris website.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

## Project Overview ##
In this project, I explore how a computer is built from the very basics - nand logic gates - to a fully functioning operating system. We go through several projects where we implement in indivdual steps layers of a computer. What follows is a cycle of implmenting, then using abstraction in order to build on the implementation. The project excellently describes how a complex machine can be designed and developed upon while using a mix of programming languages and computer hardware and computer science theory to do so.

## Resources used ##
>Logic circuit - an application used in implementing logic gates

>Relevant IDE - used to edit code

> Nand2tetris software - Custom software used to complete specific projects as obtained from the [nand2tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
