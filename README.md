# Nand2tetris #

## Note ##
All content within the project is based on the book: "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken. 

All project material and part of the software used in completion of this project has been obtained from the [nand2tetris website.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

## Project Overview ##
In this project, I explore how a computer is built from the very basics - nand logic gates - to a fully functioning operating system. We go through several projects where we implement in indivdual steps layers of a computer. What follows is a cycle of implmenting, then using abstraction in order to build on the implementation. The project excellently describes how a complex machine can be designed and developed upon while using a mix of programming languages and computer hardware and computer science theory to do so.

## Resources used ##
>Logic circuit - an application used in implementing logic gates

>Relevant IDE - used to edit code

> Nand2tetris software - Custom software used to complete specific projects as obtained from the [nand2tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

## Naviation around the project ##

The repository for this project has been layed out such that the individual projects are all within the `projects` folder. Here you will find all of the project resources.

An acknowledgements file listing any relevant sources used to complete the project.

In addition to this, several other markdown files within the `Fundementals folder` which greatly aid in the understanding of the concepts used in this project.
