## Project Overview

In this project, I explore how a computer is built from the very basics - nand logic gates - to a fully functioning operating system. We go through several projects where we implement in individual steps layers of a computer. 

What follows is a cycle of implementing, then using abstraction in order to build on the implementation. The project excellently demonstrates how a complex machine can be designed and developed upon. The intersection of computer science, computer hardware and programming is carefully explored by curating a self-discovered understanding of modern computers.

## Resources Used

- **Logic circuit** - an application used in implementing digital circuits

- **Relevant IDE** - used to edit code

- **Nand2tetris software** - Custom software used to complete specific projects as obtained from the [nand2tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

## Testing

Testing of the files may be done using custom software or with the software and files (`.tst`, `.cmp`) supplied on the [nand2tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
